                      Well, the most important thing to know is what you want to
                      accomplish. Why do you need the software? What should it
                      do? Having a clear vision of what exactly you want in mind
                      is crucial when ordering a software application. You don't
                      want to spend many months developing it with us without

                      Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Mobile apps
                      are definitely more expensive but can provide you with
                      many more data gathering, monetization capabilities than
                      web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good
                      compromise between a mobile and web app. But remember that
                      sooner or later you may need both mobile and web app and
                      when that moment comes we are here for you.

                      To give you a more precise answer we must prepare a
                      project scope and create a budget in order for us to meet
                      up with the said date. We would give you a breakdown of
                      every process and steps it would take to arrive at the
                      completion of the project. We shall tell you how much of
                      that scope can be completed within the budget and we'll be
                      able to estimate how long will it take after at least a
                      month of work. Nevertheless, if you're not happy with our
                      work after two weeks you can retract from the project with
                      no penalties, this is our trial period and we believe that
                      any reliable software house should give you one.

                      Hiring your own software developers can be a really smart
                      choice, however, recruitment process is time-consuming and
                      the costs of keeping an in-house programming team are very
                      high. You'll probably need to employ your own software
                      engineers sooner or later but hiring us can help you save
                      a lot of money and time.
